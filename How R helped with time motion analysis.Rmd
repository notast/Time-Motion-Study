# Outline 
- ### 1a) What is time motion study? 
- ### 1b) What data is needed for time motion study? 
- ### 2a) Why I should do it in `R`?

# What is time motion study?

# Example of "motion" element 
### Activities involved in hospital admissions (artificial data)
```{r echo=F}
activity_labels(patients)
```
### There can be different permutations and combinations activities for a work process
---

## Why time motion study? 
- ### Uncover the sequencing of activities in workflow 
- ### Identify bottlenecks
- ### Identify outliers when compared against a theoretical workflow model
- ### Examine the relationship between resource providers
---

## [What did my department use it for?](https://github.com/notast/Time-Motion-Study/blob/main/Conference%20Presentation_Time-motion%20analysis%20for%20productivity.pdf)
- ### Examine factors affecting productivity
- ### 1. Proportion of inappropriate referrals
- ### 2. Total duration for case management (direct and indirect patient activities)

`r chunk_reveal("eventlog", display_type = "output", title = "# What to collect")`

```{r eventlog,  include=F}
patients_df<-tibble(patients)

patients_df %>% select(time,registration_type, .order) %>% 
  left_join(patients_df %>% select(patient, .order), by=".order") %>% 
  left_join(patients_df %>% select(employee, .order), by=".order")
```
---

### When data is more than _time_ and _motion_, the analysis becomes more of process mining/process analysis
```{r echo=F}
mapping(patients)
```
--
### For simplicity, we'll call it time motion study  
---

# Where to collect data for time motion study?
- ### Observational Study 
- ### Self reporting 
- ### Logs from IT system

## 4a. `R`’s `tidyverse` 
- ### some languages are harder to learn than others due to their rules
- ### programming/scripting languages have rules too
- ### `R` has `tidyverse` rules which is beginner friendly
- ### `tidyverse` rule 1– verb heavy

## `tidyverse` rule 2– pipeline production `%>%`
```{reval=F}
Output <-Input  %>% 
               Step 1 %>% 
               Step 2 %>% 
               ... %>% 
               Last step
```

## 4b. `R` packages 
- ### `R` packages = mobile phone apps
- ### `R` has specific packages for time motion analysis that follow `tidyverse` style
- ### primary package [`bupaR`](http://bupar.net/). 7 secondary packages
